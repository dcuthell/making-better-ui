I've decided that I need to work on improving the UI of websites that I make. I like to focus on back-end stuff, mostly because I find that back-end stuff is more focused on problem solving. Front-end UI design is more of a creative task, and relies on having a working set of design skills. I'm not a very creative individual, and I'm kind of shakey on my CSS. I'd like to learn some new CSS skills and implement them on some past projects.

After about an hour of browsing around, I've learned a few things. First, everybody says the best way to get good at CSS is to practice it regularly. Second, there is a ton of information out there, and while guides like learnlayout are good for a few basic tips, I'll probably be better off by diving in and figuring out what I need to learn as I go along. Third, not using a CSS framework seems like a missed opportunity. After accidentally referencing the latest version of bootstrap while working on projects in the best, I think now is the time to update to the latest version and learn a few new things.

There's plenty of material to go through for the latest version of bootstrap. I'm interested in seeing what I can do with "cards". Before I dive into reworking the website, I'd like to figure out exactly what I'm trying to do. I know the website must:
1. Have a basic home page that connects to all other pages
2. Be mobile friendly
3. Be easy to read and navigate
4. Have a good color scheme
5. Have a personal page for myself, my cousin, and my uncle.
6. Have personal pages be 1 click away from home page.

I'm going to start by figuring out how to set a background image that will resize on all devices

I've got the background image working nicely. It will resize according to the browser window, and if there is any blank space a background color will get filled in. I'm now working on a button that will lead to the landing page to the home page that will look good both on small and large screens.

I figured out how to adjust row heights! By using height: 50vh you can set the height to 50% of the view height. It looks like vw is for view width.

It took some playing around, but I'm now pretty happy with how the enter button is positioned. The width is set to be the width of the containing column, and the height is a percentage of the view height...Wait, a better solution! I've now set the height to be a percentage of the width. This looks a lot better, and should look better on mobile as well.

To center the button within the column I needed to use display: block margins: auto.

I'm going to see what I can do now using the new carousel feature in bootstrap.

Carousel looks good!

Now that the carousel has been laid out I'd like to link the landing page to the home page.

I discovered that I can make text responsive by setting font size to a vh or vw! Apparently vmin and vmax can also be used to take the smallest or largest of the two values, respectively.

I've noticed that the carousel cards don't match up very well with the original background image; They all block out my uncle, the owner of website's domain name! I'm going to need to change the background on the home page.

..Still working on getting the background image to change >:( ...It looks like a few things were off. For starters, I was missing the url part of the background-image line. I also discovered that while the css file references the img file with a ../, the jquery css function find img with a ./. Finally, the change won't be made without event.preventDefault(), but with event.preventDefault() the address won't change...I think the best thing to do at this point would be to move the background image from body to the main div for index.html. I don't want separate css files, and this seems easy enough. In fact, I probably should have done it to begin with!

Now that the backgrounds are fixed, I'd like to have something to replace the buttons I had on the old page (Facebook and Email links for the 3 of us). Perhaps a nice navbar? I also noticed that each carousel card gets squashed pretty badly when the window is small, I should probably take a look at that...
