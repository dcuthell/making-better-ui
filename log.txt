I've decided that I need to work on improving the UI of websites that I make. I like to focus on back-end stuff, mostly because I find that back-end stuff is more focused on problem solving. Front-end UI design is more of a creative task, and relies on having a working set of design skills. I'm not a very creative individual, and I'm kind of shakey on my CSS. I'd like to learn some new CSS skills and implement them on some past projects.
