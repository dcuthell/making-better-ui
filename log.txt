I've decided that I need to work on improving the UI of websites that I make. I like to focus on back-end stuff, mostly because I find that back-end stuff is more focused on problem solving. Front-end UI design is more of a creative task, and relies on having a working set of design skills. I'm not a very creative individual, and I'm kind of shakey on my CSS. I'd like to learn some new CSS skills and implement them on some past projects.

After about an hour of browsing around, I've learned a few things. First, everybody says the best way to get good at CSS is to practice it regularly. Second, there is a ton of information out there, and while guides like learnlayout are good for a few basic tips, I'll probably be better off by diving in and figuring out what I need to learn as I go along. Third, not using a CSS framework seems like a missed opportunity. After accidentally referencing the latest version of bootstrap while working on projects in the best, I think now is the time to update to the latest version and learn a few new things.
